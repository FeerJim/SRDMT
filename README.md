Code and instances used in the manuscript "Multi-periodic scheduling with release times and deadlines on a minimum number of machines".

The **instances** folder contains all the test instances used in the computational experiments.

The folder *Flow Formulation* contains a .py file with the functions used to generate the FBM model. 

The folder *JIAM - EJIAM - LPB* contains three .py files with the functions required to generate the models JIAM, S-JIAM, EJIAM and the algorithm LPB. 

The **Tests.ipynb** file shows an example for running test instances using the different models and algorithms presented in the paper.

To generate simulated test instances, the codes in the generate instances folder were used. The **sim.py** file produces a summary of the information of each generated instance.
