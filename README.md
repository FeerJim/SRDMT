Codes and instances used in the paper Multi-periodic scheduling with release times and deadlines on a minimum number of machines

The **instances** folder contains all the test instances used to perform the computational experiments.

The folder *Flow Formulation* contains a .py file with the functions used to generate the FBM model. 

The folder *JIAM - EJIAM - LPB* contains three .py files with the functions used to generate the models JIAM, S-JIAM, EJIAM and the algorithm LPB. 

The **Tests.ipynb** file shows an example for running test instances using the different models or algorithms presented in the paper.

To generate simulated test instances, the codes in the generate instances folder were used. The **sim.py** file allows us to have a summary of the information of each generated instance.
